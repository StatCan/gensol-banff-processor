# Banff Processor release notes

## 2025-March-07 (Version `2.0.2`)

* Fixed bug where every proc in a jobs file was expected to exist, rather than just the procs which are called in the active job sequence
* New input parameters added
    * "indata_hist_filename", "indata_aux_filename" and "instatus_hist_filename"
    * Intended to replace the previous "histdata_filename", "auxdata_filename" and "histstatus_filename" though one or the other may be used until they are fully deprecated
* Fixed bug disallowing process controls using the same controlid, parameter and targetfile but different values
* Clarification regarding the use of on-disk tables in value fields of process controls has been added to the Processor User Guide
